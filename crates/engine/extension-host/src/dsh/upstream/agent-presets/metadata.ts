/**
 * A preset's display metadata: the name and description a picker shows.
 *
 * It lives in its own file because the composition is a top-level list of
 * plugin rows — YAML cannot carry sibling keys beside it, and faking a
 * metadata row would hand the Loader something to load. Keeping it separate
 * also keeps the composition exactly what its name says: a Cordis file the
 * loader owns and the cordis preset can author.
 *
 * The file carries display text ONLY. `id` is the directory name and `trust`
 * comes from the root a preset was discovered under, so neither is writable
 * here — otherwise a locally authored preset could claim to be a shipped one.
 *
 * Every read failure degrades to no metadata. A preset whose display text is
 * missing, malformed, or unreadable still mounts: presentation is not a
 * capability, and a broken name must never become an agent that cannot start.
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets/metadata
